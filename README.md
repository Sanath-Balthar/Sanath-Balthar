## üóÉÔ∏è Projects: 
<br>**Security Event Tracker Full Stack App:**<br><br>This is a multi tenant web application which is designed to receive and store event logs from IOT hardware devices of multiple customers, and display this data on the frontend based on different user roles such as Superadmins, Admins, and regular Users. Each customer would have an isolated access to the web portal and would have a separate DB setup such that there won't be any overlapping of data between customers.

Project details:<br>
‚Ä¢ Built a responsive frontend using React.js with Vite, HTML, Tailwind CSS, hooks, context API, and state management, which allows user to edit/assign priority to received events, filters the event data based on event priority, allows user to download event log or send mail to given contact.<br>
‚Ä¢ Developed backend using Express.js/Node.JS which subscribes to MQTT broker device to receive security alert event logs, extracts event details from the log and provides processed data to the frontend.<br>
‚Ä¢ Used websocket to establish connection between frontend and backend in order to send real-time event updates from backend to frontend.<br>
‚Ä¢ Used MongoDB for isolated data storage for each customer.<br>
‚Ä¢ Performed testing using Vitest and mocha, supertest frameworks for frontend and backend respectively.<br>
‚Ä¢ Deployed frontend and backend server on AWS lightsail for seamless hosting..<br>
